IShare a web application which was developed by using laravel 8. Where admin can create post, update and  delete post and user can register, login,  subscribe for event( used MailChimp API ). Also user can read post, search a specific post based on key word, author name and selecting category ( used filter scope and query string ). I used some defualt middleware and custome middleware for restict user from specific contents which they don't have permission to access. And also used validation, faker, third party javascript package called Alpine.js etc. I did this project for learning laravel 8.
